A grammatical error refers to a mistake in the structure of a sentence, violating the rules of grammar. This could involve incorrect verb tense, subject-verb disagreement, or improper use of articles. A spelling error occurs when a word is not written according to its correct spelling, which can be due to typographical mistakes or lack of knowledge of the correct spelling. Lastly, a punctuation error involves the incorrect use of punctuation marks (like commas, periods, or apostrophes), which can change the meaning of a sentence or make it difficult to understand. Each of these errors can significantly impact the clarity and professionalism of written communication.
